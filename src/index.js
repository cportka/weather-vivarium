   weather-vivarium — a tiny living weather diorama for any city.

   Public entry point. The one call most people need is `createVivarium(el, {
   city })`; the rest of the surface (catalogs, biomes, the resolver, the raw
   painter/compositor) is exported for the demo, the gallery, tests, and anyone
   who wants to build their own scene.
